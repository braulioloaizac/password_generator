# Password Generator

For this project the main objective is the creation of a password generator using Javascript in which when you push the generate button a prompt window appears and asks you the length of it, it can't be less than 8 characters and greater than 128 characters, also the prompt will ask you if you want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and/or special characters. Then the password is randomly generated and displayed to the user.

## Logic Behind the Code

First we have to ask the user the length of the password that wants to be generated, if the user enters a number less than 8 or greater than 128 the script will end and a window will be showed to the user telling him that he didn't select a valid option, if the user enters a number in that range the script will continue his excecution.

For the next step we have to ask the user if he wants to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers or special signs and with that in mind the script have to randomly generate a password, to represent the possible combinatons, i used 4 bit combinations being each one an option set by the user i.e: if the user wants uppercase letters and special signs the combination will be 1001, if the user wants the four options the combination will be 1111, giving a total of 15 cases plus one that is accessed when the user doesn't select any option in this case a new window will appear saying that the user didnÂ´t select any options.

Inside every case we have three things : availableChars, avClength and a function excecution. The first one takes a string of existing characters (created at the beginning, there is four in total) that contains the possible characters of each option and depending on each case it creates a
